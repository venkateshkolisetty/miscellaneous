=head1 NAME

  GStreamer1 - Bindings for GStreamer 1.0, the open source multimedia framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use GStreamer1;

    GStreamer1::init([ $0, @ARGV ]);
    my $pipeline = GStreamer1::parse_launch( "playbin uri=$URI" );

    $pipeline->set_state( "playing" );

    my $bus = $pipeline->get_bus;
    my $msg = $bus->timed_pop_filtered( GStreamer1::CLOCK_TIME_NONE,
        [ 'error', 'eos' ]);

    $pipeline->set_state( "null" );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GStreamer1 implements a framework that allows for processing and encoding of 
multimedia sources in a manner similar to a shell pipeline.

Because it's introspection-based, most of the classes follow directly from the 
C API.  Therefore, most of the documentation is by example rather than 
a full breakdown of the class structure.

=head1 PORTING FROM GStreamer

If you're porting from the original GStreamer module, here are some things 
to keep in mind.

=head2 ElementFactory

The original GStreamer had a version of C<< ElementFactory->make() >> which 
could be called with a list of gst plugins and associated names.  GStreamer1 
may add a similar method in the future.  For now, the bindings directly follow 
from the C interface, so they take only one at a time.

Example:

    my $rpi        = GStreamer1::ElementFactory::make( rpicamsrc => 'and_who' );
    my $h264parse  = GStreamer1::ElementFactory::make( h264parse => 'are_you' );
    my $capsfilter = GStreamer1::ElementFactory::make(
        capsfilter => 'the_proud_lord_said' );
    my $avdec_h264 = GStreamer1::ElementFactory::make(
        avdec_h264 => 'that_i_should_bow_so_low' );
    my $jpegenc    = GStreamer1::ElementFactory::make( jpegenc => 'only_a_cat' );
    my $fakesink   = GStreamer1::ElementFactory::make(
        fakesink => 'of_a_different_coat' );

=head2 Adding/linking

The original GStreamer added methods for C<< Pipeline->add() >> and 
C<< Element->link() >> that could take lists of objects.  GStreamer1 may add 
similar methods in the future.  For now, the bindings directly follow from the 
C interface, so they take only one object at a time.

Example:

    my @link = ( $rpi, $h264parse, $capsfilter, $avdec_h264, $jpegenc, $fakesink );
    $pipeline->add( $_ ) for @link;
    foreach my $i (0 .. $#link) {
        last if ! exists $link[$i+1];
        my $this = $link[$i];
        my $next = $link[$i+1];
        $this->link( $next );
    }

=head1 SPECIAL THANKS

To Torsten Sch√∂nfeld for pointing me in the right direction on creating 
this module.
