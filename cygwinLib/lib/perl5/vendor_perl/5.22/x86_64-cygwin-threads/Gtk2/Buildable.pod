=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Gtk2::Buildable interface allows objects and widgets to have
C<< <child> >> objects, special property settings, or extra custom
tags in a Gtk2::Builder UI description
(L<http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/GtkBuilder.html#BUILDER-UI>).

The main user of the Gtk2::Buildable interface is Gtk2::Builder, so
there should be very little need for applications to call any of the
Gtk2::Buildable methods.  So this documentation deals with
implementing a buildable object.

Gtk2::Builder already supports plain Glib::Object or Gtk2::Widget with
C<< <object> >> construction and C<< <property> >> settings, so
often the C<Gtk2::Buildable> interface is not needed.  The only thing
to note is that an object or widget implemented in Perl must be loaded
before building.

=head1 OVERRIDING BUILDABLE INTERFACE METHODS

The buildable interface can be added to a Perl code object or widget
subclass by putting C<Gtk2::Buildable> in the interfaces list and
implementing the following methods.

In current Gtk2-Perl the custom tags code doesn't
chain up to any buildable interfaces in superclasses.  This means for
instance if you implement Gtk2::Buildable on a new widget subclass
then you lose the <accelerator> and <accessibility> tags normally
available from Gtk2::Widget.  This will likely change in the future,
probably by chaining up by default for unhandled tags, maybe with a
way to ask deliberately not to chain.

=over

=item SET_NAME ($self, $name)

=over

=item * $name (string)

=back

This method should store I<$name> in I<$self> somehow.  For example,
Gtk2::Widget maps this to the Gtk2::Widget's C<name> property.  If you don't
implement this method, the name will be attached in object data down in C
code.  Implement this method if your object has some notion of "name" and
it makes sense to map the XML name attribute to that.

=item string = GET_NAME ($self)

If you implement C<SET_NAME>, you need to implement this method to retrieve
that name.

=item ADD_CHILD ($self, $builder, $child, $type)

=over

=item * $builder (Gtk2::Builder)

=item * $child (Glib::Object or undef)

=item * $type (string)

=back

C<ADD_CHILD> will be called to add I<$child> to I<$self>.  I<$type> can be
used to determine the kind of child.  For example, Gtk2::Container implements
this method to add a child widget to the container, and Gtk2::Notebook uses
I<$type> to distinguish between "page-label" and normal children.  The value
of I<$type> comes directly from the C<type> attribute of the XML C<child> tag.


=item SET_BUILDABLE_PROPERTY ($self, $builder, $name, $value)

=over

=item * $builder (Gtk2::Builder)

=item * $name (string)

=item * $value (scalar)

=back

This will be called to set the object property I<$name> on I<$self>, directly
from the C<property> XML tag.  It is not normally necessary to implement this
method, as the fallback simply calls C<Glib::Object::set()>.  Gtk2::Window
implements this method to delay showing itself (i.e., setting the "visible"
property) until the whole interface is created.  You can also use this to
handle properties that are not wired up through the Glib::Object property
system (though simply creating the property is easier).


=item parser or undef = CUSTOM_TAG_START ($self, $builder, $child, $tagname)

=over

=item * $builder (Gtk2::Builder)

=item * $child (Glib::Object or undef)

=item * $tagname (string)

=back

When Gtk2::Builder encounters an unknown tag while parsing the definition
of I<$self>, it will call C<CUSTOM_TAG_START> to give your code a chance
to do something with it.  If I<$tagname> was encountered inside a C<child>
tag, the corresponding object will be passed in I<$child>; otherwise,
I<$child> will be C<undef>.

Your C<CUSTOM_TAG_START> method should decide whether it supports I<$tagname>.
If not, return C<undef>.  If you do support it, return a blessed perl object
that implements three special methods to be used to parse that tag.  (These
methods are defined by GLib's GMarkupParser, which is a simple SAX-style
setup.)

=over

=item START_ELEMENT ($self, $context, $element_name, $attributes)

=over

=item * $context (Gtk2::Buildable::ParseContext)

=item * $element_name (string)

=item * $attributes (hash reference) Dictionary of all attributes of this tag.

=back


=item TEXT ($self, $context, $text)

=over

=item * $context (Gtk2::Buildable::ParseContext)

=item * $text (string) The text contained in the tag.

=back


=item END_ELEMENT ($self, $context, $element_name)

=over

=item * $context (Gtk2::Buildable::ParseContext)

=item * $element_name (string)

=back

=back

Any blessed perl object that implements these methods is valid as a parser.
(Ain't duck-typing great?)  Gtk2::Builder will hang on to this object until
the parsing is complete, and will pass it to C<CUSTOM_TAG_END> and
C<CUSTOM_FINISHED>, so you shouldn't have to worry about its lifetime.


=item CUSTOM_TAG_END ($self, $builder, $child, $tagname, $parser)

=over

=item * $builder (Gtk2::Builder)

=item * $child (Glib::Object or undef)

=item * $tagname (string)

=item * $parser (some perl object) as returned from C<CUSTOM_TAG_START>

=back

This method will be called (if it exists) when the close tag for I<$tagname>
is encountered.  I<$parser> will be the object you returned from
C<CUSTOM_TAG_START>.  I<$child> is the same object-or-undef as passed to
C<CUSTOM_TAG_START>.


=item CUSTOM_FINISHED ($self, $builder, $child, $tagname, $parser)

=over

=item * $builder (Gtk2::Builder)

=item * $child (Glib::Object or undef)

=item * $tagname (string)

=item * $parser (some perl object) as returned from C<CUSTOM_TAG_START>

=back

This method will be called (if it exists) when the parser finishes dealing
with the custom tag I<$tagname>.  I<$parser> will be the object you returned
from C<CUSTOM_TAG_START>.  I<$child> is the same object-or-undef as passed
to C<CUSTOM_TAG_START>.


=item PARSER_FINISHED ($self, $builder)

=over

=item * $builder (Gtk2::Builder)

=back

If this method exists, it will be invoked when the builder finishes parsing
the description data.  This method is handy if you need to defer any object
initialization until all of the rest of the input is parsed, most likely
because you need to refer to an object that is declared after I<$self> or
you need to perform special cleanup actions.  It is not normally necessary
to implement this method.


=item object or undef = GET_INTERNAL_CHILD ($self, $builder, $childname)

=over

=item * $builder (Gtk2::Builder)

=item * $childname (string)

=back

This will be called to fetch an internal child of I<$self>.  Implement this
method if your buildable has internal children that need to be accessed from
a UI definition.  For example, Gtk2::Dialog implements this to give access
to its internal vbox child.

If I<$childname> is unknown then return C<undef>.  (The builder will
then generally report a GError for the UI description referring to an
unknown child.)
