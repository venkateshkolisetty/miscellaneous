=item description => STRING

=item hostname => DOMAIN

The hostname of the described system.  It is preferred to use full
system names, not abbreviations.  For instance, you can better use
C<www.tux.aq> than C<www> to avoid confusion.

=item location => NICKNAME|OBJECT

The NICKNAME of a location which is defined for the same user.  You can
also specify a L<User::Identity::Location|User::Identity::Location> OBJECT.

=item name => STRING

=item os => STRING

The name of the operating system which is run on the server.  It is
advised to use the names as used by Perl's C<$^O> variable.  See the
perlvar man-page for this variable, and perlport for the possible
values.

=item parent => OBJECT

=item password => STRING

The password to be used to login.  This password must be un-encoded:
directly usable.  Be warned that storing un-encoded passwords is a
high security list.

=item username => STRING

The username to be used to login to this host.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item Error: $object is not a collection.

The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends
L<User::Identity::Collection|User::Identity::Collection>.

=item Error: Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).

Either the specified $type does not exist, or that module named $class returns
compilation errors.  If the type as specified in the warning is not
the name of a package, you specified a nickname which was not defined.
Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.

=item Error: Creation of a collection via $class failed.

The $class did compile, but it was not possible to create an object
of that class using the options you specified.

=item Error: Don't know what type of collection you want to add.

If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a
list of options which can be used to create a collection object.  In
the latter case, the type of collection must be specified.

=item Warning: No collection $name

The collection with $name does not exist and can not be created.
